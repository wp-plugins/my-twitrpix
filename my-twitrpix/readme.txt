TwitrPix is a photo sharing site for Twitter users.  So you will need to have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/signup) account if you don't already do.  Next, just login using your Twitter info at [TwitrPix](http://twitrpix.com/login) and upload some photos from your web browser, by email or a [number of Twitter apps that support TwitrPix](http://twitrpix.com/apps).  As you share your photos using TwitrPix, we automatically push those photos your Wordpress-powered blog.
